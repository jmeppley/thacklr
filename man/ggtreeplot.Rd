\source{

}
\usage{
ggtreeplot(
  ggtree,
  data = NULL,
  mapping = aes(),
  flip = FALSE,
  expand_limits = expand_scale(0, 0.6),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ggtree}{a ggtree plot object}

\item{data}{Default dataset to use for plot. If not already a data.frame,
will be converted to one by \code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}}. If not specified,
must be supplied in each layer added to the plot.}

\item{mapping}{Default list of aesthetic mappings to use for plot.
If not specified, must be supplied in each layer added to the plot.}

\item{flip}{if the final plot will be flipped}

\item{expand_limits}{Vector of range expansion constants used to add some
padding around the data, to ensure that they are placed some distance away
from the axes. Use the convenience function `expand_scale()` to generate the
values for the `expand` argument. The defaults are to expand the scale by 0.6
units on each side for discrete variables. In contrast to the `expand`
argument of the the scales functions, this expansion space is directly added
to the limits, thus all data within the limit+expansions space is plotted.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to methods. Not currently used.}
}
\description{
`ggtreeplot()` wraps `ggplot()`, and initializes a new plot in the same
way. It takes a `ggtree()` object as additional argument. It aligns the plot
data by a shared label column to the tips in the tree and fixes inconsistent
limits and plot expansion space.
